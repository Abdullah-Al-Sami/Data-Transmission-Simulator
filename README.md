# üåê Data Transmission Simulator using Cisco Packet Tracer

### **Project Type:** Networking Simulation  
### **Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer (v7.x or later)  
### **Domain:** Computer Networks & Communication Systems  

---

## üìò Project Description

The **Data Transmission Simulator** demonstrates how data packets are transmitted between devices in a network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It visualizes real-time data flow across **routers, switches, and end devices**, showing how protocols like **ARP, ICMP, TCP/IP, and routing** operate during communication.  
The project enhances understanding of **end-to-end communication**, **packet encapsulation**, and **network efficiency** through a hands-on simulation.

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate real-world network data transmission scenarios.  
- Configure routers, switches, and PCs using Cisco IOS commands.  
- Observe the OSI & TCP/IP layer operations via simulation mode.  
- Analyze data encapsulation, routing, and protocol behavior.  
- Develop skills in **LAN/WAN topology design** and **network troubleshooting**.
